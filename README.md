# Java-Lab

## Assignment 1

For this assignment we have compeleted two parts.

1. For the first part we explored various input options in Java by implementing factorial and fibonacci programs.
2. For the second assignment we explored the basics of Java by building a simple calculator program.

## Assignment 2

For this assignment we had 3 parts.

1. For this part we had the user enter variable number of elements and then we segregated those elements into an even and an odd array
2. For thia part we had the user enter the elements of an array and we detected the location of minimum distance of an element to its next. If there are multiple such instances we returned the first one.
