# Java-Lab

## Assignment 1

For this assignment we have compeleted two parts.

1. For the first part we explored various input options in Java by implementing factorial and fibonacci programs.
2. For the second assignment we explored the basics of Java by building a simple calculator program.

## Assignment 2

For this assignment we had 3 parts.

1. For this part we had the user enter variable number of elements and then we segregated those elements into an even
   and an odd array
2. For thia part we had the user enter the elements of an array and we detected the location of minimum distance of an
   element to its next. If there are multiple such instances we returned the first one.
3. For the the third part we converted a user inputed array to a list.

## Assignment 3

For this assignment we had to implement the following

1. Create a student class with the capacity to store information like prn, name, DoB, marks etc.
2. Create an array of objects of Student class and perform operations like: Add students, Display, Search (by prn, by
   name, by position), Update/Edit and Delete.

## Assignment 4

For this assignment we were supposed to implement a simulation of a deck of cards in java

1. We used java vectors to implement the deck.
2. We created card class which has access to its suite and card value.
3. The deck implemented functions such as shuffle, random card dealing, finding a card, sorting the deck and others.

## Assignment 5

This assignment had two parts

1. We implemented a shape interface and practiced interface implementation and abstraction.
2. We implemented a employee salary report generator while implementing abstract classes and inheritance.

## Assignment 6

This assignment had two parts

1. We implemented a stack interface to hold integers
    1. It came in two flavors. Fixed stack and growable stack.
    2. Learnt about inheritance through interfaces.
2. We implemented a results display section for students.
    1. Learnt about multiple inheritance through interfaces and classes.

## Assignment 7

In this assignment we have implemented rational numbers using object oriented programming
we performed basic operations like-

1. addition
2. subtraction
3. multiplication
4. division
5. absolute value
6. float value

we also used exception handling to handle bad input.

## Assignment 8

This assignment had two parts

1. We implemented the OutOfRangeException to ensure the validity of user input while calculating factorial
2. We implemented the NOMATCHEXCP to ensure that country name is always India.

We understood the process of building custom exceptions in Java. And about the features of the Java Exception class.
